            <h2>About Me</h2> <br> <a href="index.html">Go back to home</a>
            <p><i>Hello there! I'm Wilson Wanjiru, a passionate web developer with a love for crafting digital experiences. I've spent the past 6 years immersed in the ever-evolving world of web development, honing my skills and embracing new technologies along the way.</i></p>

            <p>My journey into web development began with a curiosity about how websites work and a desire to create something meaningful on the internet. Over time, that curiosity transformed into a full-fledged career that I'm incredibly grateful for.</p>

            <p>Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting projects, ranging from small business websites to complex web applications. I specialize in front-end development, and you'll often find me delving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm also well-versed in popular front-end frameworks like React and Angular, which I use to build responsive and user-friendly interfaces.</p>

            <p><b>What truly fuels my passion for web development is the ability to bring ideas to life and contribute to the digital landscape. I believe in the power of technology to make a positive impact on people's lives, and as a web developer, I strive to create seamless and accessible online experiences.</b></p>

            <p><u>Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring the latest industry trends, attending tech conferences, and participating in web development communities. Being a part of this dynamic and collaborative field inspires me to continuously improve and stay up-to-date with emerging technologies.</u></p>

            <p>When I'm not typing away at my keyboard, you can find me indulging in my love for photography, exploring nature trails, or trying out new recipes in the kitchen. I find that these diverse interests help keep my creativity flowing and provide a fresh perspective when I return to my code editor.</p>

            <p><b>One of the most fulfilling aspects of my journey has been sharing my knowledge and experiences with others. I've had the pleasure of teaching web development workshops and writing articles on various web development topics. Seeing others grow in their skills and find their passion in this field brings me immense joy.</b></p>

            <p><i>If you'd like to get in touch or discuss potential collaboration opportunities, feel free to drop me an email at <a href="mailto:wilsonmuita41@gmail.com">wilsonmuita41@gmail.com</a>.
