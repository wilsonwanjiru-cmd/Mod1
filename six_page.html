        <li>Lead a study of the topics your readers want to learn about.</li>
        <li>Utilize social media platforms like Reddit or Twitter to conduct a Q&A session with your readers.</li>
        <li>Create a survey in which you ask your audience to suggest a few topics for a course.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can begin promoting the course to your readers once you have developed it and narrowed the ideas for it. What's more, since you've considered their feedback, you as of now have clients keen on paying for it.</p>

    <h2>8. To the Contents: Begin a Training/Counseling Business</h2>

It could be about helping people lose weight, getting more clients, using better marketing strategies, or anything else. For guidance on email marketing, successful consultants like Brennan Dunn charge approximately $9,000.</p>
    <h2>9. Offer Membership Plans</h2>
    <p>The majority of online businesses, such as Netflix, Amazon, Spotify, etc., offer paid membership plans. Bloggers can also adopt subscription-based models.</p>

    <p>Countless bloggers have transitioned from selling only a few products or digital items on their sites to building successful e-commerce businesses.</p>
    <p>For example, Beardbrand, founded by Eric Bandholz, started as a blog about beard grooming and now earns more than $100k per month. Dirt Collins, who wrote about optimizing landing pages on his sites, realized his audience desired personalized templates that could be integrated into their pages. He developed Leadpages for it, and the company now generates approximately $25 million annually.</p>
    <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Blogs are the most effective method of passive income, and you can even turn them into a full-time job. There is a huge crowd across each specialty that requires quality substance, and on the off chance that you can give that, you can begin adapting through the strategies depicted in this article.</p>
